GENERAL PLAN
------------------------------

Name: GAB (Gekko Automated Backtesting)


# VIEWS

1. Selection / Run screen
- Select EXCHANGE and PAIR
- Select strategy
- candle size
- history size
- Statistics
-- Run number X
-- Successful runs / Failed runs (runs that beat market, sqlite query after each run)
-- Current best run (sqlite query + output after each successful run)

Fuck paper trader settings. Default are good for 'worst case' scenarios.

2. View screen (view all runs and statistics from all runs within a set of runs (a sqlite db))
Also calculate misc interesting stuff e.g. average params for top 10 best runs

--

# SYS

1. GAB class, deals with all core formatting needed etc
2. functions.php - misc small functions
3. js -- all the js, ajax etc needed

----

TODO:
- Cleanup select.php, move all js to scripts.js etc.
- Fix CSS, add a normal stylesheet etc, move styles to /assets etc
